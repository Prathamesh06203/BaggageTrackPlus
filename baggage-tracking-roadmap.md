# Operational Workflow

## Baggage Check-in Process
1. Passenger arrives at check-in counter
2. Staff scans passport and retrieves booking
3. Baggage is weighed and tagged
4. Tracking device is attached to baggage
5. Initial location is registered in system
6. Passenger receives tracking information

## Real-time Tracking Flow
1. Tracking device connects to airport WiFi
2. Location updates sent via MQTT
3. Server processes location data
4. Database updated with current position
5. WebSocket pushes updates to clients
6. Mobile app displays current location

## Transfer Points Tracking
1. Baggage reaches scanner point
2. Barcode is scanned automatically
3. Location and status updated
4. System calculates estimated time to next point
5. Notifications sent if needed
6. Staff alerted of any issues

## Lost Baggage Workflow
1. Missing baggage reported
2. System initiates search protocol
3. Last known location identified
4. Nearby scanners activated for search
5. Staff notified with search parameters
6. Regular updates sent to passenger

## Delivery and Claim Process
1. Baggage arrives at claim area
2. Final scan confirms arrival
3. Passenger notified of arrival
4. Claim status updated in system
5. Tracking device removed
6. Process completed in system
